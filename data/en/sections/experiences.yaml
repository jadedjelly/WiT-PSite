      # company overview
      overview: Having spent most of my career working within Windows environments, I decided to take some time out to educate myself on tools designed for Devops in order to bring such knowledge to a future Operations role where by such tools can be utilized, bringing better automation and efficiency to the organization. I focused on learning Linux-based operating systems, containerization using Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes. Additionally, I delved into the world of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, enabling me to manage and provision infrastructure resources more effectively. By acquiring this expertise, I am confident that I can make a significant impact in my future Operations role, streamlining processes and improving overall system reliability.
